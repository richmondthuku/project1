    <p><center>Young Chowder dreams of becoming a chef someday. He works as an apprentice to famous chef Mung Daal who is always offering Chowder advice on love and cooking. Panini also works in the kitchen and thinks Chowder is her boyfriend, while Shnitzel is a rock monster who doesn't think much of Chowder and his smelly best friend Kimchi the stinky cloud.
